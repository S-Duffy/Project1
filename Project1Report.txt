Project 1 Report


1. Ignoring the functionality that was added to the assignent after the Project Plan was made
   my overall estimate was fairly accurate, although the effort allocated to each line item was
   fairly inaccurate. For example, most of my code development estimates were a little aggressive.
   This is likely because I was pushing myself to use a new text editor (vim) for some part of the
   project and also because I was relatively unfamiliar with the string library which I ended up
   utilizing substantially. However, creating the makefile and managing the git repository took
   much less time than I expected. I was fairly unfamiliar with these tools before the project,
   but they were easier to use than I expected. In the case of git, this was likely because 
   I was working alone.
   
2. I did not include the development of the automated test script in my original project plan. 
   Luckily, this task did not take much effort.
   
3. TBD

4. When trying to read outside of an allocated block (assuming you ignore the warning), there 
   are 2 possible outcomes. The first possible outcome is that the read occurs normally and the
   value stored in that memory location is displayed to the screen. The second possible outcome
   is that a segmentation fault occurs because that memory address either doesn't exist or 
   is not available for reading by this program.
   
5. When trying to write outside of an allocated block (assuming you ignore the warning), there 
   are 2 possible outcomes. The first possible outcome is that the write occurs normally and the
   value is written to the unallocated memory location. The second possible outcome is that a 
   segmentation fault occurs because that memory address either doesn't exist or  is not 
   available for writing by this program.
