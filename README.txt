At this time, this project will generate an executable called Project1.exe.

Upon running this executable, a welcome message will be displayed 
along with directions to invoke the help and quit commands. The help
command will print a string that corresponds to each of the commands 
that will be supported by the end of the project (not all are supported now).
The quit command will cause the program to print an exit message and
terminate.
